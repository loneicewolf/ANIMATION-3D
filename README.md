# ANIMATION-3D
leap motion,blender,vr,etc

# GOAL AND NOTES
- it would include art, (texture,ds(?) files,etc
- stuff used: art,blender,3d modelling,animation,stuff,leap motion,maybe VR (needed or not?)
- goal: take a ART PIECE and ANIMATE IT and *perhaps* --best scenario outcome-- make it playable in VR or at thhe very least, in LeapMotion
- previous experience in this? not using art In this way, BUT, using leap motion in some animation, ive done a bit on,


# Possible work flow:
1. make a OC
2. OC's texture files (weapons.textures, oc.textures,etc) < iterate for each element "element" here means e.g "oc.items(sword,knife,bow,etc)" and "oc.texturefiles(char,knife,items,etc)" and so on
3. load it up in blender
4. use plugin leap
5. leap motion attached
6. (possibly?) VR attached
    - possible USB HUB needed?)
7. (..)
8.
