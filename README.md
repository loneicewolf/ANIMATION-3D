# ANIMATION-3D
leap motion,blender,vr,etc

# GOAL AND NOTES
- it would include art, (texture,ds(?) files,etc
- stuff used: art,blender,3d modelling,animation,stuff,leap motion,maybe VR (needed or not?)
- goal: take a ART PIECE and ANIMATE IT and *perhaps* --best scenario outcome-- make it playable in VR or at thhe very least, in LeapMotion
- previous experience in this? not using art In this way, BUT, using leap motion in some animation, ive done a bit on,


# Possible work flow:
1. make a OC
2. OC's texture files (weapons.textures, oc.textures,etc) < iterate for each element "element" here means e.g "oc.items(sword,knife,bow,etc)" and "oc.texturefiles(char,knife,items,etc)" and so on
3. load it up in blender
4. use plugin leap
5. leap motion attached
6. (possibly?) VR attached
    - possible USB HUB needed?)
7. (..)
8.

okay uh #drawing is difficult so, i will try to do a slightly* improvised solution to my #oc #characters and that is to..
Use a 
#LeapMotion #leap-motion #ultraleap
and #vr ( #oculus #rift #oculusrift ) < the older version (for compatibility)

leap motion for hand tracking(*hence hand-drawing!*)
October 8, 2025 at 4:17 PM



i could use some #vrchat LIKE method of full body tracking, (leap motion+vr) but thhe challenge is NOT about if it works, ive done it yeeaaars ago, but it was on windows, not linux so >_> we shall we if it works on #linux and if it does, ill draw texture files for stuff and #animate ( #iclone LIKE)



im just making up a plan on HOW like (code? libraries? connections? what do i even mean by all this? like, automate? I mean i still need to draw all stuff BUT
WHAT DOES THIS PLAN give me if it succeeds?:
1 tracking (hands)
2 animation capabilities trough (1)
3 perspective learning
4 POSSIBLE gamedev
